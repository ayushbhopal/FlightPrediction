# Flight Price Prediction (EDA + Feature Engineering)

## Overview

This project focuses on the preprocessing of flight data for predicting ticket prices. It employs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** techniques to prepare the dataset for machine learning models in subsequent phases.

The workflow involves:

- **Data Cleaning**
- **Feature Extraction**
- **Handling Missing Values**
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**

The end goal is to produce a clean, feature-rich dataset ready for predictive modeling.

## Objectives

- Analyze flight data to identify patterns and trends.
- Engineer key features influencing ticket prices.
- Prepare the dataset for future machine learning applications.

## Dataset Details

- **Training Dataset**: `Data_Train.xlsx`
- **Testing Dataset**: `Test_set.xlsx`

These datasets include information on:

- Airlines
- Source and Destination Cities
- Journey Dates
- Duration of Flights
- Number of Stops

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Sklearn**: Encoding categorical variables.
